# TokenManagementSystem
 
This is an web application I made when I was at third semester. This application manages QUEUEs. 

It has two side : 

i) Customer side: Customers can take tokens for service. And wait in the Queue

ii) Service Provider Side: Service Provider will call customers and when he/she is done giving service , he/she will remove the token from  connected mySql database.

Project Model:  Model View Controller. I followed MVC fashion to design this application.
                

Used technologies : Java, Servelet, JSP, mySql, jdbc, html, css, javascript, tomcat server.
